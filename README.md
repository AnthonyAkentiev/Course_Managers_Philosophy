# Lesson1

[here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/management-philosophy/lecture/ZVeCr/change-parmenides-or-heraclites)

> A CEO is in charge of change.

* Parmenides (Парменид) - "change is an illusion".
* Heraclites (Гераклит) - "Everything changes and nothing remain still...", "You can not swim twice in the same river...".
* Machiavelli (Макиавелли) - "Nothing more difficult than to change to order of the things"

## Change twice!
If you want to be a successful manager, successful strategist, you need to change twice.

## Freeze your idea. 
If you want to change reality. But the world is not frozen...

## Innovation vs Creativity
Creativity - is when someone easily changes his perception.

Innovate - to think about new system.
Creative - to build a new system.

Caramba vs Eureka.

> There is not a single example of, on this planet, of an idea that was good the day of it's birth.

Kafka: "In a fight between man and the world you better bet on world".

Edisson: "I invented 500 ideas not to produce a light bulb" ))))))

Kant: "People are like birds. There is a wind. It would be better the world without air? Air is at the same time is a problem, and a solution"
If you dont fail - you dont succeed.

Beckon: "You must obey forces you want to command"

We have 2 brains: imagination and calculation.

Move from **yes-but** to **yes-and**!

## 3 kinds of new ideas

- Science: explain something about and old thing
- Creation: create something new (you can imagine world without the Eiffel tower)
- **Invention**: create someting completely new (very hard)

# Lesson2

The goal is to think. Creative is not a goal.

CEO can't think about clients. Because he has 2mln clients. So to think about clients - he has to forget about 99% of them first.

> Step #1 of thinking is to forget! 

1) We don't control what we forget...It just happens. 
2) If you go with a friend to a movie with your friend... You will not forget same things.

## Concepts are Simplifications 

When we think - we simplify. After the football game we have our judgements like "refree was bad, this player was good". But we don't remember all moves, all episodes of the game. We have our "model". 

## Perfect Deduction - possible. Induction - not possible
