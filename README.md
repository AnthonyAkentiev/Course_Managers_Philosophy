> A CEO is in charge of change.

* Parmenides (Парменид) - "change is an illusion".
* Heraclites (Гераклит) - "Everything changes and nothing remain still...", "You can not swim twice in the same river...".
* Machiavelli (Макиавелли) - "Nothing more difficult than to change to order of the things"

## Change twice!
If you want to be a successful manager, successful strategist, you need to change twice.

## Freeze your idea. 
If you want to change reality. But the world is not frozen...

## Innovation vs Creativity
Creativity - is when someone easily changes his perception.

Innovate - to think about new system.
Creative - to build a new system.

Caramba vs Eureka.

> There is not a single example of, on this planet, of an idea that was good the day of it's birth.

Edisson: "I invented 500 ideas not to produce a light bulb" ))))))

Kant: "People are like birds. There is a wind. It would be better the world without air? Air is at the same time is a problem, and a solution"
