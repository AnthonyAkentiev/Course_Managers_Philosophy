Here are ten concepts of the model you’ve just seen in the second lecture.

Memory – Reality – Categorization– Creativity – Language – Analogy – Perception – Experience – Judgement - Uncertainty

Are they impacted by new technologies ?

1 / For each concept, assess from zero to ten how much they are impacted by new technologies.

2 / Give a one sentence explanation for each of them.
Memory

1.    Score. 10

2.     

a.    Definition. Memory is the process by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved.

b.    Explanation. The encoding and storage are no more paper/writing based or organic (brain) only but encoded in silicon-computers. The search and retrieval step is no more physical / sorted by humans (for the paper version) or effort based for the brain but relies on search engines. On top of this, we could say that silicon memory is now more or less unlimited, while organic memory was limited and not transferable automatically from one individual to another.



Reality

1.    Score 3

2.     

a.    Definition. Reality is the state of things as they actually exist, rather than as they may appear or might be imagined

b.    Explanation. While reality is still mainly understood as ‘the physical world’, more and more applications depending on Virtual Reality are emerging and will continue to develop.



Categorization

1.    Score 4

2.     

a.    Definition. Categorization is the act of sorting and organizing things according to group, class, or, as you might expect, category.

b.    Explanation. The need of categorization is getting lower thanks to full text searches in search engines.

Creativity

1.    Score 5

2.     

a.    Definition. the use of imagination or original ideas to create something; inventiveness

b.    Explanation. While creativity has been for long reserved to animals, humans particularly, technology can now compete with ‘organic creativity’. As examples the work from Blaise Aguera in AI (Google) for paintings or in Music (Emily Howell)



     Language

     1.    Score 7

     2.     

     a.    Definition. Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system.

     b.    Explanation. Technology has transformed languages since the computer boom with the creation of several languages (Cobol, Java…) – on top of this, it not unlikely that humans may be able to understand many languages in the future through automatic translations, which will completely change the acquisition need for humans



     Analogy

     1.    Score 2

     2.     

     a.    Definition. is a cognitive process of transferring information or meaning from a particular subject (the analogue or source) to another (the target),

     b.    Explanation. Analogy, part of the induction thinking, is still developing in AI (Deepmind for instance). Technology has had some limited success so far, which might accelerate in the future.



     Perception

     1.    Score. 6

     2.     

     a.    Definition. Ability to see, hear, or become aware of something through the senses; or the way in which something is regarded, understood, or interpreted.

     b.    Explanation. For most people perception has not changed through technology. However, technology has helped us understand how human perception works, and for some disabled people technology changes lives (people who are deaf can hear though Cochlear implants, and technology is improving fast for blind people.



               Experience

               1.    Score 4

               2.     

               a.    Definition. Practical contact with and observation of facts or events.

               b.    Explanation. The experience of people remains mostly ‘in the real world’. However experience can be enhanced thanks to technology (for instance personalisation thanks to data)



               Judgement

               1.    Score 6

               2.     

     a.    Definition. The ability to make considered decisions or come to sensible conclusions.

     b.    Explanation. Decision making has been highly improved already thanks to the exhaustiveness of data we can have now thanks to computers. The quality of the decisions is predicted to improve dramatically through algorithms in the next years. People may rely more on data and AI (dataism) than their own judgement in the future.



     Uncertainty

     1.    Score 9

     2.     

     a.    Definition.  Situation which involves imperfect and/or unknown information.

     b.    Explanation. On the one hand technology and science clearly reduced the uncertainty thanks to data analysis and gathering (we predict better the weather of tomorrow than 100 years ago, we know how long a Paris – New York will take). On the other hand the fact information flow is global and extremely fast, which increases uncertainty in some areas (global crisis, which jobs will remain ‘for humans’ in 20 years. Therefore the uncertainty seems to have changed subjects.
