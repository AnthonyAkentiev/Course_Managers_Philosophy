\cf2 \cb3 Are they impacted by new technologies ?\
\
Each of these concepts is highly impacted by the new technologies. For example, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence is changing the world of today. Soon we will be able to upload photos/videos of our dead relatives and be able to "speak with them" just like we speak with Siri today...\
\
1) Memory - 7/10\
We have Google. I don't need to remember who Lady Godiva was. Or how many albums did Beatles released. This information can be looked up in 2 clicks. \
\
2) Reality - 4/10\
It's a very philosophical question. I don't think reality is changed by computers. I think we are changing it with the help of computers today.\
\
3) Categorization - 9/10\
Categorization is what computers are good at. Give them gigabytes of data and they will classify it. 30 years ago it was made by humans. Could you imagine how difficult it was to prepare/keep consistent the index for the book. Or index in the book library.\
\
4) Creativity - 1/10\
Still computers are not good at creativity. Yes, they can paint you a picture just like Prisma does. But that is the only thing that humans will be always better at. Computers can/will only assist humans to write new songs, books, etc.\
\
5) Language - 5/10\
Technology is helping you to learn languages today. However - internet culture is making languages simpler (simplified). And the last thing about that - it causing globalisation. Soon we will use English (maybe Chinese) as a language of the whole humanity. So the impact is very high it think.\
\
6) Analogy - 0/10\
I don't understand how the "analogy" can be changed by a technology)  \
\
7) Perception - 5/10\

\
8) Experience - 7/10\
New technologies impact how we feel our world, adding new possibilities.  \
\
9) Judgement - 3/10\
If we are speaking about the law systems or justice -> computers can help us. But still there are a lot of ambiguity so the humans probably will always be the "final judges" (i hope). For example - It is still difficult today to migrate all hand-written contracts into the computer world (i.e. "smart contracts"). \
\
10) Uncertainty - 7/10\
We can google things. We have messengers to communicate. \cf2 \cb3 We have less uncertainty today. }
